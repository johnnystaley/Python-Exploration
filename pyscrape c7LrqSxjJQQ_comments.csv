"Hello, where can I find the source data?"
"Hi Leila, congrats on your content - great stuff. I have a question I cannot find the answer ANYWHERE: Suppose I get more data (monthly, in the form of additional ROWS). Everymonth, I have to add additional data to keep my database updated. Is there a tool that allows the addition on data in the form rows?"
I love this video
Can you that easily insert graphs and tables for each state? Thank you
I feel like I'm going crazy but I can't seem to locate the practice files anywhere in the description...
I am getting an error while clicking on close on apply and the error it is highlighting on date after putting / in merge section in date it is coming as - after clicking on date. Please help I am following the correct steps as shown in the tutorial
"Hello, is there a basic DAX functions video please? You said at the end that was for another day"
Brillant. Can't wait to try this. Thanks for this tutorial.
Thanks!
Thank u Leila🎉
Thank you for very useful information. But for foreig you speak and showing very fast
"Hi Leila! May I suggest a specific session exclusively dedicated to the part of : data modeling (relationships between tables, etc...) and another one on managing data sources (best practices on updating data sources, dos and don'ts) because most of the tutorials out there are about how to create a report but then there's not much about maintaining it, improving it starting with our own data sources, etc... Thanks in advance for your consideration and service to the community - on my job as a project controller it has been helping me a lot!"
so helpful video
"I am not able to download the files. Can anyone help me 
with that?"
"thanks for the great tutorial, it works amazing. just have a quick question, by any chance, do you know the source of the data used in the tutorial ? just using it for a homework if you dont mind"
Data set link please
"I just watched this video about Power BI and I have to say, I'm blown away by how powerful this tool is. Many thanks Leila , for the amazing job of explaining its capabilities and demonstrating its features with precision and expertise. I appreciate how engaging they were throughout the video, making it easy to follow along and understand the concepts. As someone who's been looking for a powerful data visualization tool, I can see why Power BI is such a popular choice. Thanks for sharing this informative and enjoyable video!"
"Does anyone know how to change the view on a Slicer? Microsoft changed it since this video was released. That dropdown now just tells you to go to Format > Slicer settings > Options 
> Style... which ain't there."
"Hi Leila, I am new to Power BI. I have the new version and is struggling to get the same functions as what you are showing in your videos, as they are sometimes called by another name. Where can I get something that will show me where to find what you are showing me in the new version?"
please provide practice files
"I'm getting error while loading. The error is ""failed to save modifications to the server. error returned: 'the following system error occurred: class not registered'."" I need a solution to overcome this error."
"Amazing video, I installed Power BI and came here for learning. Now... back to work. Thanks!"
"Amazing 
I am not getting the subcategory of date when i am using the slicer ?
any guidance ?"
"Hi!  I'm sure you get a lot of questions, but I'm running into an issue.  I have my own company's data (2020-2022) I'm trying to use, and I'm trying to do the YoY % Quick measure, but I'm getting some really crazy percentages. I'd also like the practice table to show each year as a column. Is there a way to do this?"
I'm not able to locate the links to download the data for this video
"Thanks Leila, let me try apply it to health care. Things like prevalance rates, treatment rates, data concordance and so one."
Keep more videos on PowerBI
Very good
Great video!! Can you do a video explaining how to change the count to sum in PowerBi.
Thanks for a lovely presentation of the TIPS - How to get % equal to 100 when you compare the sales by category of items year over year. for example type of apparel year over year where the percentages should add up to 100 % within year 2021 and so for year 2022
"hello, great video ; how to get professional account, shoud we buy a licence ?"

"Dear Leila, as Mother’s Day is approaching, would you kindly offer a discount code for Power BI training to working moms."
Isn't Excel trespassing into MS Access territory ?

Hello... I can't seem to see the files in the description section of the video which you mentioned at the start of the video for use in practice hence am kinda stuck without practice on the video.
"The perfect tutorial at the perfect moment in time... Just one question. When I include an element, for example the card, I get the categry  label marked by default Sum of Quantity... How do I get rid of the ""Sum of"". I tried with right mouse click, format, but I maybe overlooked some option?
Tks. Beside... Absolute perfect video.. Thanks..."
Thanks for the amazing tutorial!!
Thank You.  Excellent tutorial.  Would most people use the report in the PowerBI Service or create a Dashboard for end users?  Just looking for the best practice. Thank You.
"Viewed a lot of videos and this was the most helpful, thank you!"
First she is so pretty and then she is gud with what she does. She is just love.
"Hi,
How do I download the files you used?"
"Leila you're becoming most outstanding lecturer for Microsoft apps tutorials. Microsoft learners community is ever grateful.
Just getting started with Power BI, please slow motion for us to follow suite.
More Love from Africa"
You are amazing Mentor🤩 thank you so much 🙏
"Being a follower already from Excel tutorials I now make (I believe) the natural transition to Power BI tutorials. Indeed, I couldn't agree more how powerful and dynamic it is and how this solution brings the power to the end users (producer of report and reader) without being dependent on too much technical support for every single development of your own reports. So, thanks for this introduction and I take this chance to raise the good challenge of having more tutorials for Power BI and data analytics. Thanks again!"
"Leila. I watched this and studied your lesson carefully. It was great and I subscribed. I wanted to learn this. However, when I downloaded Power Bi, it will not let me in without a business e mail address which I don’t have. How can I learn this?"
"Thank you so much for the good work, we really appreciate it.
Kindly create for us Introduction to python""lessons as well."
Thank you. This has really been helpful. You have no idea of how many channels I have run through and finally your channel came along. It’s been great learning from you. Thank you ma’am. Unto the next video 🏃🏃
Can power BI give us real time data in every second through automation from any specific site like stock exchange ?
I also recommend and the teaching method is perfect...
Practice files are not available
"the quick measure thing is stunning, thanks alot!"
"Hi Leila, this is my first time using power bi. When I try to get data (excel), the Load and transform data options are greyed out. I checked out various forums, enabled Options-> DirectQuery for PBI datasets and AS. Still not working. What should I do?"
Love it
"I love the video, really powerful. It makes me to go ahead and do more reporting at work"
"Thanks, is there is a way to use the outputs at detailed states in a country?"
Great explanation for a beginner like myself ❤
Thanks
Is it free
Love this tutorial no faffing around.  Just exactly what I  needed.  Thanks
"I'm registering for your full immersion course.

Respected Ma'am You are Great Teacher.

excuse me. i can ot download  the invoice data. please help me! thanks.
Thank you very much for this.  Never used Power BI.  I am a SAP Functional and Developer for a good size Medical Devices company and can see many uses for this tool once others in the company get acquainted with it.  (I can also see a million IT Ticket for extracting and exporting SAP Table data out to SQL for  them to use in Power BI).
Hi I'm looking for a way to combine min and sum. I have a big table.with sales amount for every day and for different products. I want to sum the amount of sales by product by date and to find the date with minimum amound sold. For example for product A for the last month i have sales every day and on 10.10.2022 i have the least amoun of sales which is 3. I want to show in a table the least amound sold by date by product for every month from the beggining of 2016 until now.
"Awesome, Concise explanations at the perfect pace!  Thanks Leila!"

"My favorite teacher ! Thanks Leila, BI made easy !"
"Very good tutorial ... after creating BI file any change in data source should  be updated again.. let say if we have 5 year projected financial statements in excel budget model and based on scenarios analysis income statement, balance sheet, cash flow numbers are changed and with each scenario.and we show changes in sale, bank balance, net profit capital required in charts that are linked to the financial statements...can you guide..thanks"
Are there things Power BI does Excel can't do with a pivot graph?
This was very helpful
Very useful. Thank you!

"Hello, where can I find the source data?"
"Hi Leila, congrats on your content - great stuff. I have a question I cannot find the answer ANYWHERE: Suppose I get more data (monthly, in the form of additional ROWS). Everymonth, I have to add additional data to keep my database updated. Is there a tool that allows the addition on data in the form rows?"
I love this video
Can you that easily insert graphs and tables for each state? Thank you
I feel like I'm going crazy but I can't seem to locate the practice files anywhere in the description...
I am getting an error while clicking on close on apply and the error it is highlighting on date after putting / in merge section in date it is coming as - after clicking on date. Please help I am following the correct steps as shown in the tutorial
"Hello, is there a basic DAX functions video please? You said at the end that was for another day"
Brillant. Can't wait to try this. Thanks for this tutorial.
Thanks!
Thank u Leila🎉
Thank you for very useful information. But for foreig you speak and showing very fast
"Hi Leila! May I suggest a specific session exclusively dedicated to the part of : data modeling (relationships between tables, etc...) and another one on managing data sources (best practices on updating data sources, dos and don'ts) because most of the tutorials out there are about how to create a report but then there's not much about maintaining it, improving it starting with our own data sources, etc... Thanks in advance for your consideration and service to the community - on my job as a project controller it has been helping me a lot!"
so helpful video
"I am not able to download the files. Can anyone help me 
with that?"
"thanks for the great tutorial, it works amazing. just have a quick question, by any chance, do you know the source of the data used in the tutorial ? just using it for a homework if you dont mind"
Data set link please
"I just watched this video about Power BI and I have to say, I'm blown away by how powerful this tool is. Many thanks Leila , for the amazing job of explaining its capabilities and demonstrating its features with precision and expertise. I appreciate how engaging they were throughout the video, making it easy to follow along and understand the concepts. As someone who's been looking for a powerful data visualization tool, I can see why Power BI is such a popular choice. Thanks for sharing this informative and enjoyable video!"
"Does anyone know how to change the view on a Slicer? Microsoft changed it since this video was released. That dropdown now just tells you to go to Format > Slicer settings > Options

"Hi Leila, I am new to Power BI. I have the new version and is struggling to get the same functions as what you are showing in your videos, as they are sometimes called by another name. Where can I get something that will show me where to find what you are showing me in the new version?"
please provide practice files
"I'm getting error while loading. The error is ""failed to save modifications to the server. error returned: 'the following system error occurred: class not registered'."" I need a solution to overcome this error."
"Amazing video, I installed Power BI and came here for learning. Now... back to work. Thanks!"
"Amazing 
I am not getting the subcategory of date when i am using the slicer ?

"Hi!  I'm sure you get a lot of questions, but I'm running into an issue.  I have my own company's data (2020-2022) I'm trying to use, and I'm trying to do the YoY % Quick measure, but I'm getting some really crazy percentages. I'd also like the practice table to show each year as a column. Is there a way to do this?"

"Thanks Leila, let me try apply it to health care. Things like prevalance rates, treatment rates, data concordance and so one."
Keep more videos on PowerBI
Very good
Great video!! Can you do a video explaining how to change the count to sum in PowerBi.
Thanks for a lovely presentation of the TIPS - How to get % equal to 100 when you compare the sales by category of items year over year. for example type of apparel year over year where the percentages should add up to 100 % within year 2021 and so for year 2022
"hello, great video ; how to get professional account, shoud we buy a licence ?"

Hello... I can't seem to see the files in the description section of the video which you mentioned at the start of the video for use in practice hence am kinda stuck without practice on the video.
"The perfect tutorial at the perfect moment in time... Just one question. When I include an element, for example the card, I get the categry  label marked by default Sum of Quantity... How do I get rid of the ""Sum of"". I tried with right mouse click, format, but I maybe overlooked some option?
Tks. Beside... Absolute perfect video.. Thanks..."
Thanks for the amazing tutorial!!
Thank You.  Excellent tutorial.  Would most people use the report in the PowerBI Service or create a Dashboard for end users?  Just looking for the best practice. Thank You.
"Viewed a lot of videos and this was the most helpful, thank you!"
First she is so pretty and then she is gud with what she does. She is just love.
"Hi,
How do I download the files you used?"
"Leila you're becoming most outstanding lecturer for Microsoft apps tutorials. Microsoft learners community is ever grateful.
Just getting started with Power BI, please slow motion for us to follow suite.
More Love from Africa"
You are amazing Mentor🤩 thank you so much 🙏
"Being a follower already from Excel tutorials I now make (I believe) the natural transition to Power BI tutorials. Indeed, I couldn't agree more how powerful and dynamic it is and how this solution brings the power to the end users (producer of report and reader) without being dependent on too much technical support for every single development of your own reports. So, thanks for this introduction and I take this chance to raise the good challenge of having more tutorials for Power BI and data analytics. Thanks again!"
"Leila. I watched this and studied your lesson carefully. It was great and I subscribed. I wanted to learn this. However, when I downloaded Power Bi, it will not let me in without a business e mail address which I don’t have. How can I learn this?"
"Thank you so much for the good work, we really appreciate it.
Kindly create for us Introduction to python""lessons as well."
Thank you. This has really been helpful. You have no idea of how many channels I have run through and finally your channel came along. It’s been great learning from you. Thank you ma’am. Unto the next video 🏃🏃
Can power BI give us real time data in every second through automation from any specific site like stock exchange ?
I also recommend and the teaching method is perfect...
Practice files are not available
"the quick measure thing is stunning, thanks alot!"
"Hi Leila, this is my first time using power bi. When I try to get data (excel), the Load and transform data options are greyed out. I checked out various forums, enabled Options-> DirectQuery for PBI datasets and AS. Still not working. What should I do?"
Love it
"I love the video, really powerful. It makes me to go ahead and do more reporting at work"
"Thanks, is there is a way to use the outputs at detailed states in a country?"
Great explanation for a beginner like myself ❤
Thanks
Is it free
Love this tutorial no faffing around.  Just exactly what I  needed.  Thanks
"I'm registering for your full immersion course.

Respected Ma'am You are Great Teacher.

excuse me. i can ot download  the invoice data. please help me! thanks.
Thank you very much for this.  Never used Power BI.  I am a SAP Functional and Developer for a good size Medical Devices company and can see many uses for this tool once others in the company get acquainted with it.  (I can also see a million IT Ticket for extracting and exporting SAP Table data out to SQL for  them to use in Power BI).
Hi I'm looking for a way to combine min and sum. I have a big table.with sales amount for every day and for different products. I want to sum the amount of sales by product by date and to find the date with minimum amound sold. For example for product A for the last month i have sales every day and on 10.10.2022 i have the least amoun of sales which is 3. I want to show in a table the least amound sold by date by product for every month from the beggining of 2016 until now.
"Awesome, Concise explanations at the perfect pace!  Thanks Leila!"
"Your explanations are brilliant, love it 💚"

(I can also see a million IT Ticket for extracting and exporting SAP Table data out to SQL for  them to use in Power BI).
Hi I'm looking for a way to combine min and sum. I have a big table.with sales amount for every day and for different products. I want to sum the amount of sales by product by date and to find the date with minimum amound sold. For example for product A for the last month i have sales every day and on 10.10.2022 i have the least amoun of sales which is 3. I want to show in a table the least amound sold by date by product for every month from the beggining of 2016 until now.
